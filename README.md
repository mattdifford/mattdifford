### Hi there 👋

I'm a full-stack PHP developer, with experience in back-end and front-end specific roles.

I love creating beautiful, elegant websites and UIs, as well as solving complex proplems and business logic requirements, focusing on the simplest possible solutions.

My commercial experience includes:
- SCSS/LESS ✨(I like to use BEM wherever I can)
- Jekyll/Liquid 💎
- PHP (including in a custom MVC framework, and Laravel 8) 🐘
- MySQL 🐬
- jQuery/Javascript 📝
- React ⚛️
- Git :octocat:
- Azure Cloud Computing ☁️

Any bugs or dodgy commit messages are definitely caused by my cats walking across my keyboard, and not by me
